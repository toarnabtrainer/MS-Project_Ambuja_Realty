**PERT - Program Evaluation Review Technique**<br>
**Three-point analysis:**<br>
* **Most Likely Estimate (M)** = Estimate of the most likely value of the duration <br>
* **Optimistic Estimate (O)** = Estimate of the duration under the most favourable conditions <br>
* **Pessimistic Estimate (P)** = Estimate of the duration under the most unfavourable conditions <br>

**PERT = (P + O + 4M) / 6**<br>
**Standard Deviation = (P - O) / 6**<br>
**Variance = Standard Deviation ^ 2**<br>
